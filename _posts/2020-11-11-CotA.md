**Conquerors of the Abyss** is my first long-term game development project. 

# Disclaimer

This project is first and foremost was made for learning. Plenty of the design choices are deliberately impractical, in order to try out different tools and technologies in actual use. Because of this, the scope of the game became quite impossible to handle for just one person. In the end I decided to finish only a simple demonstration of the core gameplay and abandon the project in its current form.

## Implemented Features

* 99% vector graphic UI made with [NoesisGUI](https://www.noesisengine.com/)
* Character customisation tool
* Multiple connected randomly generated dungeons with pre determined layouts
* Enemies trying to kill the player
* Different skills for attack
* One main resource - Focus. Every action the player can take reduces this or its regeneration

## Used Technologies

* [Unity 2019.4](https://unity.com/releases/2019-lts)
* [NoesisGUI](https://www.noesisengine.com/)
